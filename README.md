### <img src="https://raw.github.com/ZhengyuLiang24/BasicLFSR/main/figs/Thumbnail.jpg" width="1000">

This repository provides an enhanced and unified toolbox for Light Field (LF) Image Super-Resolution (SR), supporting both:

- **LFSSR** – LF Spatial SR (improving resolution of each sub-view image)
- **LFASR** – LF Angular SR (increasing angular resolution and enabling novel view synthesis)

This is an extension of our previous work, **[BasicLFSR](https://github.com/ZhengyuLiang24/BasicLFSR)**, which focused solely on spatial SR. 
It has proven to be a helpful toolbox for researchers to quickly get started with LF spatial SR and to facilitate the development of new algorithms. 

Looking ahead, **[BasicLFSR-plus](https://github.com/ZhengyuLeung/BasicLFSR-plus)**, together with our **[BasicLFDisp](https://github.com/yourname/BasicLFDisp)** repository for LF disparity estimation, aims to provide a more comprehensive and user-friendly benchmark toolbox for the LF research community.
